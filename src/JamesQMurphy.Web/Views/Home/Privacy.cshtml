<p>
    @webSiteTitle ("The Website") does not collect any personal information, nor does it employ any use of "tracking" cookies.
    The Website serves as my personal blog, and a demonstration of how to deploy a web site using DevOps best practices.  At
    this time, the Website is in a "read-only" mode, so there is no way to send <i>any</i> data to the site, let alone personal
    data.  If this changes in the future, then this policy will be updated, and a mechanism will be employed to let users
    know of the updated policy.
</p>
<p>

    The Website is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">API Gateway</a>
    service.
