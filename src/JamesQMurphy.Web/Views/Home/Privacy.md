We here at @webSiteTitle (hereafter referred to as "the Website") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your policy.  This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how you can control this information.

This policy applies only to this Website.  This website contains links to other websites which are not governed by this policy.

# Information We Collect

By visiting the WebSite and using its features and services, you provide certain personal data in a variety of means.  This information can be classified into two types of information:  Information you voluntarily provide to us,  information that we automatically collect, and information collected from other sources.

## Information You Voluntarily Provide To Us

__Registration__.  If you choose to register directly with the Website, you must provide a username and a valid email address.  The Website will store this information in our database.  The Website will verify the email address by sending a confirmation email message to the email address, and the Website will keep track of which email addresses have been confirmed.  The username does not have to be your real identity.  

You may also choose to register through a third-party social provider, such as [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) or [GitHub](https://www.github.com).  If you register through one of these providers, you must still provide a username, but an email address is optional.  The username does not have to be your real identity and it does not need to match the username used on the third-party social provider.  When you use one of these services, the Website receives and stores information that uniquely identifies your account on the service.  The Website uses this information to properly authenticate your account. The website may also receive certain additional information about you from these third-party sites, including, but not limited to, your username and email address.  The Website may use this information to suggest a username during the registration process, but it does not store this information in our database unless you explicitly use it during the registration process.

The Website reserved the right to delete your account for any reason, including choosing a username that can be construed as harmful, inflammatory, or intentionally misleading.
