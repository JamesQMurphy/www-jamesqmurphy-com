We here at @webSiteTitle (hereafter referred to as "the Website") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data.  This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how you can control this information.  The policy applies only to this Website.  The Website contains links to other websites which are not governed by this policy.

This Privacy Policy is subject to change and was last updated on November 15, 2019.


# Information We Collect

By visiting the WebSite and using its features and services, you provide certain personal data in a variety of means.  This information can be classified into two types of information:  Information you voluntarily provide to us,  information that we automatically collect, and information collected from other sources.

## Information You Voluntarily Provide To Us

__Registration (Sign-Up)__.  If you choose to register directly with the Website, you must provide a username, a valid email address, and a password.  The Website will store the username, email address, and a hashed version of your password in our database.  The Website will verify the email address by sending a confirmation email message to the email address, and the Website will keep track of which email addresses have been verified.  The username does not have to be your real identity.  

You may also choose to register through a third-party social provider, such as [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) or [GitHub](https://www.github.com).  If you register through one of these providers, you must still provide a username, but you do not need to provide a password nor an email address.  The username does not have to be your real identity and it does not need to match the username used on the third-party social provider.  When you use one of these third-party services, the Website receives and stores information that uniquely identifies your account on the third-party service.  This allows the Website to verify your identity during future visits to the Website. The website may also receive additional information about you from these third-party sites, including, but not limited to, your username and email address.  The Website may use this information to suggest a username during the registration process, but it does not store this information in our database unless you explicitly use it during the registration process.

The Website reservs the right to delete your account for any reason, including choosing a username that can be construed as harmful, inflammatory, or intentionally misleading.

__Comments__.  The Website allows registered users to post comments to articles on the website.  If you wish to leave a comment on an article, you must register with the website.  Comments are publicly visible to all users of the website, including users that are not registered.  

You retain the rights to your copyrighted content, except as described below:

*  By submitting comments to the Website, you grant the Website a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.
*  You cannot permanently delete your comments.  You may choose to hide the comments that you post, provided you maintain an active registration on the Website.  The comments will no longer be publicly visible; however, others may have posted copies of portions of your comments.
*  If you choose to delete your account (see below), you forfeit the rights to any comments that you post.

__Contact Us Page__.  The Website maintains a [contact us](/contact) page to allow users to leave feedback and ask questions.  You do not need to register to use the Contact Us page, but if you are registered and signed into the site, that information is captured as well.  Any information that you provide via the Contact Us page will be stored in our systems and potentially sent via email to the administrators of the Website.  When submitting content through the Contact Us page, you grant the Website a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.
