We here at @webSiteTitle ("the Website") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data.  This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how you can control this information.  The policy applies only to this Website.  The Website contains links to other websites which are not governed by this policy.

This Privacy Policy is subject to change and was last updated on March 12, 2020.


# Information We Collect

By visiting the WebSite and using its features and services, you provide certain personal data in a variety of means.  This information can be classified into two types of information:  Information you voluntarily provide to us,  information that we automatically collect, and information collected from other sources.

## Information You Voluntarily Provide To Us

__Registration (Sign-Up)__.  If you choose to register directly with the Website, you must provide a username, a valid email address, and a password.  The Website will store the username, email address, and a hashed version of your password in our database.  The Website will verify the email address by sending a confirmation email message to the email address, and the Website will keep track of which email addresses have been verified.  The username does not have to be your real identity.  

You may also choose to register through a third-party social provider, such as [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) or [GitHub](https://www.github.com).  If you register through one of these providers, you must still provide a username, but you do not need to provide a password nor an email address.  The username does not have to be your real identity and it does not need to match the username used on the third-party social provider.  When you use one of these third-party services, the Website receives and stores information that uniquely identifies your account on the third-party service.  This allows the Website to verify your identity during future visits to the Website. The website may also receive additional information about you from these third-party sites, including, but not limited to, your username and email address.  The Website may use this information to suggest a username during the registration process, but it does not store this information in our database unless you explicitly use it during the registration process.

__Comments__.  The Website allows registered users to post comments to articles.  If you wish to leave a comment on an article, you must register with the Website.  Comments are publicly visible to all users of the Website, including, but not limited to:
* Other registered users
* Users and visitors to the Website that are not registered
* Search Engine "bots" and RSS Feed Aggregators

__Contact Us Page__.  The Website maintains a [Get In Touch](/contact) ("Contact page") to allow users to leave feedback and ask questions.  You do not need to register to use the Contact page, but if you are registered and signed into the site, that information is captured as well.  Any information that you provide via the Contact page will be stored in our systems and potentially sent via email to the administrators of the Website.
