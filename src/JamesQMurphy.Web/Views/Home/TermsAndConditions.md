**Welcome to @webSiteTitle!**

By accessing or viewing @webSiteTitle (hereafter referred to as "the Website"), you are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions.  Please review them carefully.  These Terms and Conditions are subject to change and we reserve the right to change them, at our sole discretion, at any time and for any reason.  These Terms and Conditions are made publicly available on the Website and it is your responsibility to review them periodically.  As such, you waive any right to receive specific notice of individual updates.

These Terms and Conditions were last updated on February 1, 2020.

The information provided on the Website is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, if you choose to access the Website, you agree that you do so on your own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The storage and transfer of information on the Website is governed by the Privacy Policy.  We strongly urge to to review our Privacy Policy.  By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you also agree to the Privacy Policy.

# Account Registration

Content such as blog posts and comments are publicly available to everyone.  As such, these Terms and Conditions apply to all users of the Website, whether or not you create an account with the Website.  If you wish to contribute (post) your own comments, you are required to register (sign up) with the Website by creating an account.  All information provided during the registration process is subject to the Website's Privacy Policy.  Even if you choose not to register with the Website, you still agree to these Terms and Conditions.

There are two methods of registration:

* You may use a valid email address and password of your own choosing, subject to the password complexity requirements.  The Website will confirm the validity of the email address by sending a verification message to the email address.  The verification message will contain a link back to the Website.  Clicking or visiting this link will complete the registration.  If you use an email address and password to register with the Website, you agree to maintain the confidentiality of the password, and not share your password with anybody.
* You may use one of the third-party social network providers, such as Twitter or GitHub ("Providers").  Using a Provider does not require you to provide an email address to the Website.  When registering with a Provider, the Website receives a unique identifier from the Provider's website.  This unique identifier is stored in the database as described in the Privacy Policy.

In either case, you must choose a username that will uniquely represent you on the Website.  Your username will appear next to or beside every comment that you post on the Website.  The username does not have to be your real or legal name and can be changed at a later time, provided that it is not in use by any other registered users.  The Website reserves the right to change or alter your username if it deems the username to be inappropriate, at our sole discretion.  If you (or the Website) change your username, any comments that you previously posted will be updated to display your new username.  You acknowledge that this process is not immediate and it may take a reasonable amount of time for your new username to appear.

By registering with the Website, you represent and warrant that:

1. All registration information you submit will be true, accurate, current, and complete.
1. You will maintain the accuracy of the registration information, and promptly update the information as necessary.
1. You have the legal capacity and you agree to comply with these Terms and Conditions, as well as the Privacy Policy.
1. You are at least 16 years old.
1. You will not use the Website for any illegal or unauthorized purposes.
1. You will not create user accounts by automated means or under false pretenses.
1. Your use of the Website will not violate any applicable law or regulation.

You are also prohibited from the following activities:

1. You may not attempt to impersonate another user or person or use the username of another user.
1. You may not sell or otherwise transfer your account.
1. You may not create multiple accounts without the expressed written consent of the Website.

The Website may, at any time and at our sole discretion, suspend, lock, or terminate your account, and refuse any and all current or future use of the Website (or any portion thereof).

The Website reserves the right to limit the ability to edit comments that you post.
